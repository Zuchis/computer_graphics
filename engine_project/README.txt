IMPORTANT :
    Please do not use the Makefile on the base directory of the project, it's incomplete...
    I'm sorry about this, but it will be fixed as soon as possible


To make the executable, do the following:
    1 - enter the src directory
    2 - run make
    3 - run the executable

At the moment there's only one entry, the others will be added as soon as possible.

Thank you for the cooperation!
